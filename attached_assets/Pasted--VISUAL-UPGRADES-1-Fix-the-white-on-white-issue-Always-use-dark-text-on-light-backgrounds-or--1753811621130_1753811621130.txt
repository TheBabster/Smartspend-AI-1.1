🎨 VISUAL UPGRADES

1. Fix the white-on-white issue
	•	Always use dark text on light backgrounds or vice versa.
	•	Add slight shadows or outline to text for readability on layered visuals.

2. Add rich backgrounds
	•	Use soft gradient backgrounds or light textures (e.g. subtle waves or dots).
	•	Assign unique colour themes per category (e.g. blue for Bills, green for Food).
	•	Allow optional dark mode toggle.

3. Improve Smartie’s design
	•	Redraw Smartie in vector-style with better proportions, softer outlines, and richer shading.
	•	Give Smartie multiple emotional states (happy, proud, warning, etc.)
	•	Use motion: blinking eyes, nodding head, floating idle animation.

4. Replace the smiley face
	•	Use Smartie or a meaningful emoji (💡, 🎯, 🧠) on the purple page.
	•	Make it dynamic: change image based on financial mood (e.g. if overspending → sad Smartie).

5. New Logo
	•	Create a new logo that includes Smartie or something more distinct:
	•	A coin with a brain engraved.
	•	A dollar sign inside a lightbulb.
	•	A “S” and a stylized tree (linking to savings tree).
	•	Make it simple, flat, and App Store–ready.

6. More visual feedback
	•	Animate elements like sliders, progress bars, or streaks.
	•	Add hover animations on buttons.
