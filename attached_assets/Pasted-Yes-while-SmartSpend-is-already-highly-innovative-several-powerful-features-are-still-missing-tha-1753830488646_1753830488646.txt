Yes — while SmartSpend is already highly innovative, several powerful features are still missing that would elevate it to a true 10/10 product. To start, the app needs a real-time spending integration, either via Open Banking APIs or manual bank sync, so users don’t need to input every transaction themselves. This boosts retention by removing friction and offering instant feedback. Next, introduce predictive budgeting tools — for example, Smartie could forecast how much a user will save or overspend by the end of the month based on current patterns and upcoming expenses. To take the behavioural angle further, add purchase context logging — a short optional note or voice tag users can leave on each expense like “Lunch with Mum” or “Late-night craving,” which helps them emotionally reflect and better remember. To make Smartie feel more alive and deeply personalised, include a smart tone adjuster: Smartie becomes more supportive when a user is stressed, more energetic when they’re motivated, and more empathetic when they overspend — creating a truly adaptive AI companion. To encourage long-term engagement, add a progress map or Smartie Journey, where users can see their financial growth visualised as a path, with milestones (like “First Week Streak”, “First £100 Saved”, “Impulse Free Month”) celebrated along the way. Add custom alerts and triggers: for example, if a user’s food spending exceeds 30% of their budget or if they shop during stress 3 times in a row, Smartie could proactively intervene with tips or challenges. Integrate a mindful spending mode, where purchases over a certain threshold trigger a short Smartie reflection: “Take a breath. Will this make you happier next week?” Lastly, to expand beyond solo use, add a collaborative budgeting feature — users could share a goal with a partner or friend (e.g. saving for a trip), with both contributing and receiving shared Smartie updates. These features — real-time tracking, emotional context, predictive analytics, adaptive tone, custom alerts, and collaborative tools — fill in the last remaining gaps, completing the behavioural-fintech loop. With them, SmartSpend would become not just a helpful tool, but a daily financial coach and lifestyle companion — emotionally intelligent, deeply useful, and impossible to uninstall.
