💡 Suggestions for Improvement:

1. Make Smartie Feel More Interactive (Personality & Usefulness)
	•	Add voice or animation (e.g. Smartie blinking, talking bubble popping up with “Need help? Click me!”).
	•	Occasionally have Smartie wave or hold up signs like “New feature!” or “Streak reset?”

2. Improve Dark Mode Readability
	•	Some text (e.g. testimonial and email log-in under the CTA) blends too much into the background.
	•	Slightly increase contrast or add a subtle glow or box-shadow around those text blocks.

3. Add Progress Summary Widget
	•	On login, show:
	•	“You’ve saved £X this month”
	•	“You’re on track to hit your monthly goal 🎯”
	•	Mood summary: “You logged your mood 4 times this week”

4. Animated Transitions Between Modes
	•	When toggling between day/night mode, animate Smartie changing outfits (e.g. sunglasses in the day, blanket & moon cap at night).

5. Microinteractions
	•	Add hover or tap effects on the tiles (Smart Budgeting / AI Insights / Goal Tracking), such as slight lift or glow.
	•	Confetti or sparkles when a new insight is displayed or goal is completed.

6. More Personalization on Welcome Line
	•	Example:
	•	“Welcome back, Alex! You’re on day 5 of your streak – let’s keep it going 🔥”

7. Mood Logging CTA Box
	•	Consider giving “Log Your Mood” its own box (like the other 3 feature tiles) with a mini emoji face that changes expression.
	•	Button can animate on hover (e.g. bounce, pulse).

8. Dynamic Testimonial Carousel
	•	Rotate between 2–3 different testimonials with photos or country flags for visual interest.
