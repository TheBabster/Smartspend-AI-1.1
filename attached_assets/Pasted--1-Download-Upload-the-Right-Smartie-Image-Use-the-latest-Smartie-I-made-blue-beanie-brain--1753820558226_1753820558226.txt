1. Download & Upload the Right Smartie Image:
	•	Use the latest Smartie I made (blue beanie, brain texture, orange shoes, white gloves, expressive eyes, defined arms/legs).
	•	You can export this as .png with a transparent background.
	•	Upload that exact image to Replit and place it wherever Smartie appears in your app.

2. Fix Scaling & Sharpness:
	•	Make sure Smartie scales responsively and retains sharpness on all screen sizes.
	•	Use SVG or 2x PNG assets to keep high resolution.
	•	Apply consistent padding/margin so it doesn’t touch edges or float too far.

3. Use Smartie Poses Dynamically:
	•	Assign different Smartie poses for different contexts:
	•	🎉 Celebration (arms up)
	•	👋 Welcome (waving)
	•	💭 Thinking (hand on chin)
	•	😔 Sad (head down)
	•	🏃‍♂️ Running (one leg up)

🖌️ Visual Polish Tips

To match the pro version:

🟣 Example Instructions for Replit Agent

“Replace current Smartie with this PNG version. Set width to 110px, position absolute with slight offset. Animate idle blink every 4s, breathing rise/fall every 2s. When streak increases, play 1s ‘arms up jump’ animation and show confetti particles. On hover, do 1-bounce wiggle. When user saves money, show quick fist pump and sparkle.”
