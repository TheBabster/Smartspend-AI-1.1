Frontend Improvements:
	•	Use streaming responses like ChatGPT for more natural typing.
	•	Allow users to click on Smartie’s reply to expand for more tips (“Show detailed breakdown”).
	•	Add voice input and reply with TTS (text-to-speech) for mobile friendliness.

🛍️ 3. Smartie Shop & Avatar System

You mentioned accessories but didn’t finish—this is crucial:
	•	Add dressing animation: When user equips an item (hat, glasses), Smartie changes visibly on all screens.
	•	Unlockable perks: E.g., if user earns 100 SmartCoins, unlock “Savings Mode” hat that enables bonus features like Smart Suggestions or streak boosters.
	•	Emotional responses: If a user makes poor financial decisions, Smartie frowns. If user breaks a streak, Smartie cries a little. Subtle animations help bond with the character.

💡 4. Feature & Dashboard Enhancements

To make your homepage feel dynamic, intelligent, and ultra-useful:
	•	Daily Insight Card: A rotating daily tip/analysis like “Yesterday you saved £8 by skipping takeout! That’s a win!” with Smartie thumbs-up.
	•	Goal Tracking Widget: Show user’s current savings vs goal in a progress donut.
	•	Impulse Control Heatmap: A visual graph of spending impulses throughout the week/month. Label with emojis (🔥 for impulse, 🧘 for calm).
	•	Notification System:
	•	Push reminders: “You haven’t made a Smart Purchase today! Stay streaky 🌟”
	•	Weekly summary: “This week you saved £42 — enough for that hoodie you wanted 🎽”

🎨 5. Visual Polish & Design Enhancements

You’re already at an 8.7–9.0 visually. Push to a 10 by:
	•	Add micro-animations: Button hover effects, confetti pop when a user saves money or completes a Smart Streak.
	•	Gradient upgrades: Make buttons have smooth transitions from one gradient state to another on hover (like modern Apple UI).
	•	Smartie mood animation: Based on user score or recent choices, Smartie’s face/emotion shifts dynamically.
	•	Dark mode: Allow toggle — already started, now polish with better contrast and Smartie color adaptation.
	•	Use neumorphism sparingly for cards and inputs to give a modern soft depth feel.

📊 6. Behavioural Analytics Engine

This takes your app to a new level — Smartie should feel smarter than the user:
	•	Decision Pattern Recognition: Track regret/satisfaction scores after each decision. Learn the user’s tendencies and reflect back:
“You tend to regret purchases made between 9–11 PM. Want to set a spending pause for those hours?”
	•	Spending Mood Tracker: Show monthly pie chart of purchases made in happy vs. stressed states.
	•	Smart Reminders: When emotion + time + history align, Smartie should intervene:
“Looks like you often splurge on tech on Fridays. Want a 24hr lock on tech category this weekend?”
