I am building a mobile-first budgeting and behavioural finance app called SmartSpend, which helps users make smarter purchase decisions in real time, track their financial goals, and build long-term habits of mindful spending. The core concept is simple but powerful: users input their income, fixed expenses (like rent, food, subscriptions), and then get live, gamified feedback on whether a new purchase is a smart decision based on their budget, their emotional state, and long-term goals. I want you to design and build a sleek, responsive, mobile-optimised version of SmartSpend with a beautiful interface, fluid animations, and strong habit-forming mechanics. The app should include an interactive decision-making interface where users log potential purchases by entering the item name, price, desire level (1–10), category (e.g. Fashion, Tech, Food, Fun, Other), and a utility score (1–10). The app then returns one of three outcomes: “Yes, buy it,” “Think again,” or “No,” along with a brief, friendly rationale and motivational advice from an animated in-app assistant called Smartie. Smartie is a cartoon-style assistant (like a friendly robot or owl) who reacts visually (blinking, floating, bouncing) and uses speech bubbles to encourage or advise the user. I want Smartie to appear during decision interactions and on the homepage to celebrate wins, track streaks, and remind users to make smart choices. The homepage should feature a clean, modern layout with three core sections: a savings goal tracker (with tree visuals that grow as users progress toward their savings goal), a decision history section that fills in after a user has made a few decisions (like a timeline or bar chart with colour-coded outcomes), and a SmartPoints + streak tracker showing how many good decisions the user has made. The app should track spending against a monthly budget, with a visual progress bar showing how much has been spent and how much remains. All visuals must be smooth, colourful, emoji-friendly, and playful—think Duolingo meets Mint, with celebratory confetti when goals are hit, Smartie animations, and polished transitions. There should be a bottom nav bar with icons for: Home, Analytics, Goals, and Settings. In the Analytics tab, show charts of past purchase decisions, impulse scores, most expensive categories, and money saved. The Goals tab allows users to set multiple savings goals with visual icons (trees, rockets, gift boxes) and displays percentage progress, amount saved, and time estimates. The Settings tab should include a dark mode toggle, notification preferences, and optional integrations (e.g. allow Google sign-in or allow users to enable reminders). The backend must store user inputs, purchase history, budget data, and goal progress. You can use Replit DB, Firebase, or Supabase. All state must persist even after refresh. Later, I may integrate OpenAI API for Smartie to speak using natural language and provide deeper behavioural insights. You must write clean, modular, well-commented JavaScript (or TypeScript), and use modern React or Next.js framework if possible. Use CSS animations, Framer Motion, or GSAP for smooth transitions. All screens must be responsive and mobile-first, with special attention to spacing, touch areas, and UX clarity. I want the app to be fun to use, beautiful to look at, and addictively helpful. Make it feel like a life-changing financial coach in your pocket. Build it from this vision and structure the code so I can continue adding new features like AI chatbot replies, social leaderboards, and purchase trends over time. SmartSpend should feel like a joyful and intelligent finance companion—build it to be 10/10.
