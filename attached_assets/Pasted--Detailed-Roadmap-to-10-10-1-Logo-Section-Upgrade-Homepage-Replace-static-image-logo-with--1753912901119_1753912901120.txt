🛠️ Detailed Roadmap to 10/10

1. Logo Section Upgrade (Homepage)
	•	Replace static image logo with an animated SVG version (fade-in or scale-up on load)
	•	Add a soft-glow or pulse animation behind logo when streak is active
	•	Use Framer Motion or React Spring for entry animations of tagline and logo

⸻

2. Mascot Enhancement (Smartie)
	•	Animate Smartie slightly (bounce, wave, blink on load or speak)
	•	Use Lottie files (JSON animations) or animated GIFs instead of static PNGs
	•	Add sound toggle: “Smartie says…” with playful audio cues on specific messages

⸻

3. Mood Tracker Improvements
	•	Move mood tracker higher or embed inside a Smartie pop-up
	•	Show current streak or weekly mood chart for more engagement
	•	Include a progress circle around Smartie showing engagement completion (like Duolingo)

⸻

4. Microinteractions
	•	Add button hover transitions (color shift, depth)
	•	Add subtle loading animations when switching tabs
	•	Use floating sparkles or coin drops when user reaches streaks/goals

⸻

5. Gamification Boost
	•	Add badges (e.g. “5-Day Streak!”, “Budget Master”) shown next to Smartie
	•	Introduce level-up feedback animation on “Savings Tree Level” or “Financial Wellness Score”
	•	Make “Score: 21” clickable with a modal popup to break down components (what affects score?)

⸻

6. Quick Actions Completion
	•	Fill in placeholders with real tools:
	•	“Log Expense”
	•	“Set Goal”
	•	“Adjust Budget”
	•	“Ask Smartie (AI)”
	•	Each card should have its own icon, animation, and unique feedback

⸻

7. Daily Smart Tip Upgrade
	•	Rotate tip every 24h with animation (slide-in/slide-out)
	•	Allow users to “like” or “save” tips
	•	Smartie could “deliver” the tip by walking across screen

⸻

8. Dark Mode Toggle
	•	Add a toggle button (🌙/☀️) in top-right with a transition
	•	Implement full dark mode theme, matching your brand colors
	•	Smartie could change outfit for dark mode (bonus flair)

⸻

9. App Store Polish Features
	•	Add visual onboarding tour with arrows/tips the first time a user logs in
	•	Add feedback button (e.g. “Suggest a Feature”)
	•	Integrate tactile animations on mobile (e.g. card bounce, success haptics)

⸻

10. Accessibility & Quality
	•	Ensure full mobile responsiveness (which you’re already doing very well)
	•	Add alt text for logos and Smartie visuals
	•	Add proper loading skeletons for pages and components that rely on delay
