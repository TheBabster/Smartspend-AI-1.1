Build a visually stunning, deeply interactive, and psychologically optimized financial wellness app called SmartSpend. The app should feature a fully responsive mobile-first layout with clean, minimalist design in a pastel palette. The home screen should greet the user dynamically based on the time of day (e.g., “Good Morning, Alex!”) and show a circular animated budget meter indicating total monthly budget remaining (with smooth transitions). Below that, dynamically generate spending categories like “Food & Dining”, “Entertainment”, “Shopping”, each with an animated horizontal bar, dynamic hover effects, and remaining budget values. Include an AI character named Smartie—a glowing animated bubble assistant that gives short motivational financial insights (e.g. “You’ve saved $127 on food—why not put that toward your savings goal?”). Smartie must be context-aware and trigger responses based on user trends. Add a bottom navigation bar with icons for: Home, Decisions (past advice log), Goals (savings goals with progress bars), and Insights (weekly/monthly analytics with bar graphs, pie charts, and trend arrows). Include Quick Actions at the top (“Add Expense” and “Purchase Decision”) with floating buttons and modal pop-ups using smooth slide-in transitions. Enable gamification elements: visual badges for achievements (e.g., “3 weeks under budget”), a daily streak counter, XP points, and a “Savings Tree” that grows when the user avoids impulse spending. Add subtle micro-interactions—buttons that pop slightly, sliders with tactile feedback, transitions that fade in elegantly. Allow customization of categories, icons, emoji labels, and budgets. Implement push notifications and habit nudges (e.g., “Let’s check in on your goals today”), and an optional Smartie voice-over mode. Finally, optimize everything with local storage caching and performance rendering to avoid lag on mobile. The design should feel alive, rewarding, and deeply personal—like a blend of Calm, Headspace, and Duolingo, but for money.
