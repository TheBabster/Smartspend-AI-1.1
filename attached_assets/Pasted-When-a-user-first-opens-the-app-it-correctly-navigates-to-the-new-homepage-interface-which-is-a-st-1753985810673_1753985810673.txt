When a user first opens the app, it correctly navigates to the new homepage interface, which is a strong improvement. However, several issues and enhancements need to be addressed to ensure a clean, personalised, and professional user experience. Firstly, on the main dashboard, the greeting message still displays “Good evening, Loading…!” instead of showing the user’s name. This needs to be fixed by fetching the user’s name from the database—the one they originally submitted during signup—and rendering it dynamically to provide a personalised greeting such as “Good evening, Daniel” or their chosen name. Secondly, while the navigation from the dashboard to functional components (such as “Add Expense” or “View Budget”) now works smoothly, there is still a major problem: previously entered data from another user or a test session appears when accessing the features. For example, expenses like Netflix subscriptions, Tesco groceries, and bus fare were shown despite the current user never inputting these. This suggests shared or unsegregated test data is still being loaded by default. When a new user signs up or logs in for the first time, the app must start in a clean state with no existing expenses, budgets, or Smart Purchase history. It should prompt the user to complete their Financial Setup—such as entering their income, financial goals, and budget categories—and then store that securely to their unique user ID in Firebase. Furthermore, once a user navigates into a function (e.g. budget view or adding an expense), there needs to be a consistent way to return to the new dashboard. Currently, clicking back leads to the old dashboard, which breaks the experience. The old dashboard should be entirely deprecated and removed from the project, and all features—such as Financial Wellness Score, Smartie interactions, buttons, and personalisation—should be transferred and integrated into the new dashboard layout (the one shown in the first screenshot). The design of this new dashboard should remain visually consistent, clean, and modern, with no regression to the outdated UI.

Additionally, the “Chat with Smartie” feature needs a major upgrade. At present, it only responds with limited, predefined messages and does not behave like a real financial coach. The goal should be to make it work more like ChatGPT: able to handle a wide range of queries, even silly or unexpected ones, and give personalised, useful, and informative financial guidance or encouragement in response. Integrating a true AI chat backend (e.g. using OpenAI’s API) with dynamic prompt generation based on the user’s data (like budget or goals) will make this possible. Lastly, the onboarding flow for new users is too basic. When a user first signs up, they should go through a short, friendly setup wizard where they input their financial situation, preferences, income, budget categories, savings goals, and priorities. This data should then be stored under their user ID and used to personalise their entire SmartSpend experience. This way, every time they log in, they are greeted with their customised SmartSpend journey—one that continues where they left off and adapts to their real financial habits. Fixing these issues will elevate SmartSpend to a world-class personalised finance coaching app.
