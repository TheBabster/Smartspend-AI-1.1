The goal is to make SmartSpend’s UI visually flawless and highly appealing—clean, consistent, intuitive, and modern—across all screens. The welcome screens should consistently use Smartie (the assistant mascot) with smooth, friendly messaging that sets the tone. Keep the Smartie intro bubble on a semi-transparent soft gradient background (like purple-pink) with subtle animation if possible. Ensure the welcome phrase (“Welcome to Financial Freedom!” or “Welcome aboard!”) feels unified and professional across all versions—use one strong, confident version and reuse it consistently. The top progress bar should be elegant, minimally styled, and aligned with the app’s palette—thin, rounded dots or a single smooth bar that animates per step. Ensure all headers and subtext are centrally aligned with strong font hierarchy: bold black header (h1 or h2 style), followed by a soft grey explanatory line beneath (p tag with subtle spacing and lighter weight). The currency input section should use large touch-friendly buttons with hover/click animations. Use toggle-style currency buttons (e.g., GBP, USD, EUR) with clear border radius, icon, and selection highlight. The income input field should have a card-like shadow and padding, a faint £ icon inside, and an info icon below explaining what income includes (as shown—e.g., freelance, salary). The “Continue” button should be sticky, large, centred, and with a rich, dynamic gradient (e.g., purple to pink), and hover + click effects. Remove any text overflow, whitespace glitches, or padding inconsistencies between mobile/tablet modes. Make sure all emoji (e.g., 💰, 😊, 👋) are aligned perfectly with adjacent text, ideally slightly smaller than surrounding font. Font consistency matters—use the same sans-serif family with a light/medium/bold system (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or SF Pro Text). Colour palette should be coherent: white background, accent purple/pink for CTA, soft grey for support text, and visual emojis/icons for warmth. Overall, the goal is to unify visual language—same Smartie positioning, font hierarchy, padding, button design, colour tones, animations, and emoji placement across all intro/onboarding slides. Final visual preview must be pixel-perfect, gradient-rich, responsive for mobile screens, and ultra-consistent. Design polish must rival top apps like Duolingo, Headspace, and Notion in onboarding quality.
