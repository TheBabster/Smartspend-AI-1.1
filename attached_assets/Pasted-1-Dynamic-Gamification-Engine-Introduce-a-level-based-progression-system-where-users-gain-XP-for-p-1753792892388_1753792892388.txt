🧠 Smartie Mascot Integration: Make It Iconic, Alive, and Central

Smartie needs to evolve from a static assistant to a living, expressive coach who guides, celebrates, and emotionally connects with users. Here’s exactly how to achieve that:
	1.	Character Development
	•	Give Smartie a personality: encouraging, quirky, and insightful. Let it praise, joke, warn, and empathise.
	•	Define states: 🎉Celebrating, 🧠Thinking, 😟Concerned, 🎯Focused, 😎Proud — change Smartie’s expression and voice tone accordingly.
	•	Add “Smartie’s Mood” linked to user’s FWS and budget actions.
	2.	Visual Animation System
	•	Add subtle animations: blink, nod, hover, confetti burst.
	•	React to events: Smartie jumps when a goal is hit, looks disappointed if streak breaks.
	3.	Voice or Audio Option (Phase 3)
	•	Optional: Let Smartie speak encouragements using TTS (text-to-speech) for even stronger emotional reinforcement.
	4.	Smartie’s Corner Upgrade
	•	Build a personalised feed where Smartie shares:
	•	Motivational quotes 💬
	•	AI insights 💡
	•	Funny finance memes 😅
	•	Milestone recaps 🏅
	•	“Smartie Secrets” – advanced finance tips 🧠
	5.	Customisation
	•	Let users change Smartie’s colour scheme, outfit, voice tone (cheerful, chill, wise), or even “species” (e.g. bot, animal, alien).

By placing Smartie at the emotional and strategic core of the app — blending its assistant logic, emotional responses, and visuals — SmartSpend transforms from a tool into a financial companion, which is what will make it unforgettable.
