	•	“Yes, buy it” / “Think again” / “No” with a score (e.g. 92% SMART decision).
	•	Visual emojis to indicate emotion.
	•	A graph: how this purchase affects your savings streak and Financial Wellness Score.

4. Progress, Streak, and Savings Tree Enhancements
	•	Visual savings tree animation: every £100 saved = a branch or fruit on the tree.
	•	Add a “garden mode” or “smart forest” where the user can see their streak and savings visualised (gamification layer).
	•	Allow users to tap trees for fun financial tips from Smartie.

5. AI Personalization Boost

	•	Highlights where the user saved most, where they overspent.
	•	Suggests one actionable goal for next week.
	•	Use OpenAI to generate spending challenges or reflections like:
	•	“You spent £48 on coffee this month. Could you go for 3 homemade cups next week?”
