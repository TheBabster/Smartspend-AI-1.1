Based on the current screenshots, your SmartSpend app’s Financial Insights and Smart Purchase Decision features are already in excellent shape, scoring around 8.5–8.7/10. The visuals are clean, Smartie adds personality, and the layout is intuitive. But to push this system to a full 10/10, you’ll need to deepen the intelligence, personalize the insights, and gamify the experience even further. First, enhance the Smart Purchase Decision feature by linking it directly to savings goals—for example, showing how a purchase would delay progress toward a goal like the PlayStation 5. Add richer AI logic that factors in past emotional states, budget levels, category trends, and purchase regret history—so Smartie can say things like, “You tend to regret coffee purchases when bored.” Let users interact with Smartie in a chat-like flow before big decisions, and allow them to adjust the smartness rating after the fact to help the AI learn. Add rewards for good decisions like Smart Points, streaks, or mini achievements (“3 smart buys in a row!”), and consider subtle visual polish like animated emoji sparkles or gradient card backgrounds for dopamine feedback.

Then, in the Financial Insights section, increase the depth and coaching feel. Add a weekly Smartie summary that includes highlights (“This week, your smartness score improved 12%”), as well as emotion-spending heatmaps that show patterns (“You spent most while stressed”). Let users see trends over time, predict goal timelines at current saving rates, and run simulations (“What if I saved £5 more each week?”). Introduce regret cost analysis—showing how much they’ve spent on impulse or regretful buys—and gamify progress with badges and rewards. Finally, add social value with a share/export option: generate a card-style visual summary of a week’s decisions or a goal milestone that users can share. By layering in these features, you’ll transform SmartSpend into a fully gamified, emotionally intelligent, AI-powered financial coach that feels alive, helpful, and delightful. With that level of polish, functionality, and originality, your app will easily reach 10/10
