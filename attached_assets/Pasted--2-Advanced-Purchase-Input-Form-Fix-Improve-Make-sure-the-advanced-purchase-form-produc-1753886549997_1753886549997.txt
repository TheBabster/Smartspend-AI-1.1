🛍️ 2. Advanced Purchase Input Form (Fix & Improve):
	•	Make sure the advanced purchase form (product name, cost, desire level, emotional state, category) is clearly visible and accessible on the main screen or via an easy-to-locate “Smart Buy” tab.
	•	Visually polish the input form layout (better spacing, label alignment, smooth transitions).
	•	Fix any issues where the form doesn’t appear or is unresponsive.
	•	The desire level slider should update a Smartie face in real-time with a smooth visual/emotional animation.

👤 3. User Accounts + Financial Profile Setup:
	•	Add a Sign Up / Log In / Log Out flow (can use Supabase or Firebase).
	•	When users sign up, ask them key financial info:
	•	Monthly income
	•	Rent & fixed costs
	•	Current savings
	•	Spending limits or goals
	•	Save this to their account. Allow them to update this later from a “My Finances” page.
	•	After logging in, they should see their dashboard with their name and financial summary.

🧠 4. Smartie’s AI Decision System (Contextual Advice):
	•	Make Smartie’s analysis consider the user’s financial situation.
	•	E.g., if the user has £500 savings and is about to buy a £150 luxury item, Smartie should say “Think Again” or “No” depending on emotional state and desire level.
	•	Keep responses emotionally intelligent and personalised using the user’s saved profile data.
	•	Smartie should still use emotional data + price + desire level + category, but now add financial status as context.

📊 5. My Purchases History Section:
	•	Create a tab or page called “My Purchases”
	•	Log every Smart Purchase request including:
	•	Product name
	•	Price
	•	Desire level
	•	Emotional state
	•	Category
	•	Smartie’s decision (Yes / Think Again / No)
	•	Date
	•	Let users delete or edit items. Let them sort/filter by date or decision type.

⸻

🌱 6. Savings Tree Polish (Gamified Visual):
	•	Improve the “Savings Tree” by making it animate (grow leaves or get greener as user builds streaks or saves more).
	•	Tie it to streak count or total saved.
	•	Optional: Add small Smartie animations near the tree for encouragement (“Looking good!” / “Keep saving!”).

⸻

🧠 7. Smartie’s Corner Improvements:
	•	Add a rotating set of motivational messages / budgeting facts.
	•	Let the user tap Smartie to trigger a budgeting tip or encouragement.
	•	Visually make Smartie look consistent across pages.

⸻

💬 8. Add Smart Alerts / Budget Warnings:
