## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built as a single-page application (SPA) using:
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and component-based architecture
- **Vite** for fast development builds and hot module replacement
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom CSS variables for consistent design system
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and microinteractions
- **shadcn/ui** components for consistent, accessible UI elements
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **TanStack Query** for server state management and caching

The frontend follows a mobile-first responsive design approach with support for both light and dark themes.

### Backend Architecture
The backend uses a RESTful API architecture built with:
- **Express.js** with TypeScript for the web server
- **Node.js** as the runtime environment
- **ESM modules** for modern JavaScript module support
- **Custom storage abstraction layer** for database operations

### Component Structure
- **Pages**: Main route components (Dashboard, Analytics, Goals, Decisions, etc.)
- **UI Components**: Reusable design system components from shadcn/ui
- **Custom Components**: App-specific components (Smartie, BudgetRing, CategoryCard, etc.)

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment

- **Replit integration** with development banner and cartographer plugin

### Production Build
- **Vite build** generates optimized frontend bundle
- **esbuild** bundles server code for Node.js deployment
- **Static file serving** for production frontend assets
- **Environment-based configuration** for database and API keys

### File Structure
```
/client          # Frontend React application
/server          # Backend Express API
/shared          # Shared TypeScript types and schemas
/migrations      # Database migration files
/attached_assets # Design specifications and requirements
```

The application is designed to run on Replit with seamless development experience, including error overlays and hot reloading. Production deployment follows standard Node.js patterns with separate frontend and backend builds.

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for route components
- Optimized bundle splitting with Vite
- Efficient re-renders with React Query caching
- Responsive images and assets
- Progressive Web App capabilities ready for implementation
